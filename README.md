    • Manage tasks (insert, update, list, delete)

    • Prioritize tasks

    • Singleton for activity logging system

    • An adapter to make existing classes work with others without changing legacy code

    • Observer to allow certain objects to notify other objects about changes in their state (in-game notification system)
